Circuit Connection Details for Ultrasonic Distance Indicator
1. ATtiny13A

Power Supply

VCC (Pin 8) → +5V

GND (Pin 4) → Ground

HC-SR04 Connections

VCC → +5V

GND → Ground

TRIG → PB0 (Pin 5)

ECHO → PB1 (Pin 6)

LED Connection

Anode (+) → PB2 (Pin 7)

Cathode (–) → 220Ω Resistor → Ground

Notes

Use a common ground for all components

✅ General Notes for All Controllers

Use a common ground for all components

Ensure stable 5V power supply

Place a 0.1µF decoupling capacitor near each microcontroller

Keep HC-SR04 echo wire short to avoid false readings

LED current-limiting resistor is mandatory
